# hello-world
this is a test repo - it is very garrulous
|
so this is one of those places where I tell you that I am a planner, as in town planning
but policy and economics is my suit
|
now I would say that data is the key to policy and economics - data is missing error 404 (for data.data)
|
so I would synthesize data here and simulate an environment for policy - lets see where that gets us
